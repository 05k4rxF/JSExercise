# JavaScript exercises
Here you can find few of my simple exercises made with JavaScript for learning purposes.

1. Clock - Just a simple circle with hands of the clock moving, and showing current time. Nothing special. I learned here how I can modify style properties of elements and work with use of time.

2. Drum Kit - This exercise showed me how to properly work with external files and how to react on users keyboard input.

3. Gallery - A simple trainging how to make things on the screen look smooth and pretty and - again - how to change styles properties. 

4. Maps - Map where you can leave a pointer and see where exactly it is in the real world. When you check "page 2" you will find Latitudes and Longitudes for all your pointers. You can also move your pointers by simply dragging them.

5. Sketch - I learned how to work with canvas. You can play here a bit and draw some colorful, cool looking lines. When you are drawing size and color of your brush constantly changes - it gets bigger, smaller and goes through all colors.

6. Snake - Simple snake game. Black background, green snake (squares) and your target - red squares - which gives you points and makes your snake larger.

7. TicTacToe - I thought I should make something differnet and... I've made TicTacToe game. But this time i used ReactJS. First and hopefully not last React project.
